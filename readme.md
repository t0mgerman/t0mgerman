I currently develop SPFX solutions and web applications for the UK's NHS (national health service) in the North West. 

I studied Digital Media at Edge Hill University, and first worked with SharePoint while at the MoD - it's a platform I've worked with for ~13 years - and I'm now enjoying getting to work with the wider Microsoft 365 eco-system. 

A lot of my day to day work is confidential or hosted privately, but I hope to be able to make contributions to projects where I can and - if I get time - I'd also like to throw some personal/hobbyist work up here. We'll see!
